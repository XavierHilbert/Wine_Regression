I preformed an analysis on wine using data from stores near Chapel Hill, NC. 

Main takeaways
- Confirmed most results from earlier study done in 2020
- Found being aged in oak has a positive affect on price
- Found abv has a positive affect on price (though there could be collinearity with age)

The pdf in the repo contains the full analysis.
